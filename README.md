Buy Cheap, Buy Twice

So I bought these cheap chinese Arduino Nano Clones (I'm thrifty...). Then, I felt the need to re-program via ISP because I somehow broke some fuses (WTF?). Except the ISP programming wouldn't work, neither with my (real Atmel) JTAGICE3 not with a (real Atmel) STK500. WTF. 

This seems to be a common problem. Solution as per https://forum.arduino.cc/t/my-stk500-board-is-unable-to-program-generic-nano-boards-with-icsp/573408  
Just hold down the reset button.

Buy cheap, buy twice (or re-solder).
